# overview of DB

data problemï¼›
  1. data embedded into APP, cannot stored separately
  2. access depending on the administrator.

file based data disadvantage:
  1. lack of separation and isolation
  2. duplicating needs too much space
  3. multi parts require multi access
  4.incompatible formats
  5. satisfy specific request 
 
DBMS hanle request from APP to use data
  1. reduce complexity
  2. provide a level of security
  3. provide customiize the appearance
  4. unchanging structure
  
 DB:1.logically related data; 2. system catalog
 DBMS: to operate on DB
 redundancy represents relationship between two objects in DB
 
 use DB
  1. control of data redundancy
  2. data consistency
  3. more information from data
  4. share data
  5. improve integrity
  6. improve security
  7. enforcement of standards
  8. economy of scale
  9.balance conflicting requirement
  10. improved data accessibility
  11. increase productivity
  12. improve maintenance through data independence
  13. increase concurrency
  14. improve backup
 
cons
  1.complexity 2. size 3. cost 4. hardware cost
  5. converting data to DB   6. performance degrade for time increase
  7. higher impact of a failure
  
 role of DB user
  1. data administrator
  2. DB administrator
  3. DB designer
  4. programmer
  5. end users

# overview of DB architecture
hardware architecture 80s-90s download file before use data
clien-server architecture (default architecture to duilb modern DB)
  client                            server
  manage the user interface         accept DB
  accept & check syntax of input    check authorization
  process logic                     ensure integrity
  generate DB request to server     transmit response to client
  pass response to user             naintain system catalog
  
 too many tiers: 1. require considerable resources  2. VIP overhead
 
 1 tier client -> 2tier application server -> 3tier DB server
 
 thin client pros: 1. economical hardware  2. APP maintenance centralized   3. beter separation
 
 Transaction Processing Monitor : brain of connect server and client
 
 funneling - switch of TPM
